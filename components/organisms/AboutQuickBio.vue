            Span a few years to one year before I started college. I needed to
            buy a PC to submit my assignments. So during the summer of 2008, I
            worked so hard cleaning hotels with my mother. I now had enough
            money to buy my first computer a

            with an enormous amount of Ram totalling 2GB and an intel Celeron
            with duo cores. The best part was it was running everyone's
            favourite Windows version

            windows broke the

            I had no clue how to fix it and no other device to search how to fix
            it. I was then forced to use the library to find a solution get a
            windows disc this seemed almost impossible. I started to ask what is
            Windows and is there an alternative. The answer was Yes!

            . I encountered problems I was unable to download the ISO. So I
            asked canonical for a disc and enclosed a cheque to cover the
            shipping. From that day I have used Linux ever since. The distros I
            commonly use now are

            . The idea of making games for Xbox seemed great. It gave me a
            moment of nostalgia with my mom. Which lead me to learn C# from<a

            out of interest as well as a samba server. All in my free time.
            During my final year of studies, I was responsible for creating
            experiments with python and using libraries such as
