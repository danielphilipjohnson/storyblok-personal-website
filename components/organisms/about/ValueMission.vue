            I always try to leave the world a better place than yesterday. I try
            to give advice related to programming and personal. I always try 99%
            of the time to help the best I can. If I don't know the answer. I
            will try my hardest to find the answer or find another person that
            can help you. I keep almost all my code 99.9% opensource for others
            to look at and use on<a

            Currently, I'm finishing off my language studies with the Spanish
            language. I know that speaking and reading in the English language
            is a blessing. Many people do not have access to good programming
            content due to it being in English. Providing a language barrier.
            Also, most educational content is not reasonably priced when you
            convert it to other currencies. For instance, Peruvian Soles to
            Dollars it can make courses very expensive. This is something I'm
            serious about addressing and hoping to help with. That's why I
            volunteer my time and money to help those from South America and
            North America. I want to also make educational content that is
            accessible to as much of the world as possible. If you would like to
            help by converting my future tutorials, blog and books to other
            languages. Please let me know :). I'm happy to give you credit. I
            hope we can all make educational content more accessible to those
            who desire to program can do it.
